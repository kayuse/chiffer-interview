# Getting Started With Node, Express and Postgres (using Sequelize)

This repo houses code for the blog ["Getting Started with Node, Express and Postgres (using Sequelize)"](https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-node-express-and-postgres-using-sequelize)

Code for various sections is separated into branches, so if you're working through the tutorial and you get stuck, you can always checkout the corresponding branch and refer.

I have editted this code for the Chiffer Interview Process. Thanks Sidarth ;)

Have fun! 😄
